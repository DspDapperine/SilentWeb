A remake of the original Silent Hill game is officially in development at Bloober Team, with Konami confirming the project during its Konami Press Start Live showcase in June 2025.
 The remake is being developed by the same team responsible for the critically acclaimed Silent Hill 2 remake, which sold 2 million copies and received high praise for its atmosphere and storytelling.
 The original Silent Hill, released in 1999 for the PlayStation, introduced players to the fog-shrouded town of Silent Hill and the story of Harry Mason searching for his missing adopted daughter, Cheryl, encountering disturbing revelations tied to a mysterious cult and supernatural forces.
 The game is noted for its pioneering use of fog and darkness to enhance atmosphere and its focus on an everyman protagonist, setting it apart from contemporaries in the survival horror genre.
 While the remake's release date has not been announced, a report from July 2025 suggests it is reportedly three years into development and targeting a 2027 launch.
 The original game is considered a masterpiece by many, praised for its writing, pacing, memorable characters, and defining atmosphere, though it is also noted for its challenging gameplay, including "tank-controls" and a strict grading system.
 Despite being a numbered sequel, Silent Hill 2 is a standalone story, meaning players do not need to play the first game to understand the narrative of the remake.
 The game follows Harry Mason as he searches for his missing adopted daughter in the eponymous fictional American town of Silent Hill. Stumbling upon a cult conducting a rite to revive a deity it worships, he discovers her true origin. Five game endings are possible, depending on the actions taken by the player, including one joke ending.

Silent Hill received positive reviews from critics upon its release and was commercially successful. It is considered by many to be one of the greatest video games ever made, as well as a defining title in the survival horror genre, moving away the elements from B movie horror genre to more psychological horror, emphasizing atmosphere.[3] Various adaptations and expansions of Silent Hill have been released, including a 2001 visual novel, the 2006 feature film Silent Hill, and a 2009 reimagining of the game titled Silent Hill: Shattered Memories. The game was followed by Silent Hill 2 in 2001 and a direct sequel, Silent Hill 3, in 2003. A remake by Bloober Team was announced to be in development in June 2025.[4]
